Exercise 2

UNF
Not all key attributes are assigned.
DB(staffNo,dentistName,patientNo,patientName,appointment,surgeryNo)

1NF
Data in 1NF, all key attributes are assigned and there are no repeating groups
DB(staffNo,dentistName,patientNo,patientName,appointmentDate,appointmentTime,surgeryNo)

A primary key needs to be assigned. Because there is no unique key a combination of keys is selected as primary key.

staffNo + appointment(appointmentDate) is selected as primary key.

DB(<staffNo>,dentistName,patientNo,patientName,<appointmentDate>,<appointmentTime>,surgeryNo)

2NF
No partial dependencies: each attribute depends on the entire primary key.
dentistName: depends only on staffNo. Not ok
patientNo: depends on entire primary key. ok
patientName: depends on entire primary key. ok
appointmentTime: depends only on appointment.Date. Not ok
surgeryNo: depends on entire primary key. ok

Dentist(<staffNo>, dentistName)
DB(<staffNo>,<appointmentDate>,<appointmentTime>,patientNo,patientName,surgeryNo)

3NF
No transitive dependencies (non-key attribute depends on another non-key attribute)
PatientName depends on patientNo. Not ok

Dentist(<staffNo>, dentistName)
Patient(<patientNo>,patientName)
DB(<staffNo>,<appointmentDate>,<appointmentTime>,patientNo,surgeryNo)

3BCNF
Every determinant is a primary key.
dentistName is a determinant and a candidate key. Ok
patientName is a determinant and a candidate key. Ok
patientNo is a determinant and a candidate key. Ok
surgeryNo is not a determinant. Ok

3NF=3BCNF
